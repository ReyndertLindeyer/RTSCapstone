# Robo Reclamation
Robo Reclamation is a 3D RTS game built using Unreal Engine 4. Inspired by elements from both the Command and Conquer games and the Supreme Commander games.

In the game itself we have features and mechanics such as building construction and destruction, resource harvesting, unit ordering and combat, and enemy AI which path to player buildings and will destroy them.

We have a small tutorial map with a few scripted events as well as a skirmish map where the player is simply dropped into command of a Construction Yard and has to clear the map of all enemy spawners to win.
